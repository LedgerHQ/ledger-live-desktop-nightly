# Ledger Live Desktop Nightly

This repository is dedicated to the [Ledger Live Desktop](https://www.github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-desktop) nightly releases. The releases are synchronized every night with the develop branch of the main repository. 

## Disclaimer :warning:

Nightly releases are **bleeding edge** versions of the Ledger Live Desktop app, and thus _may_ and _will_ contain bug. It has a built-in auto update system and will do so at every release, and will not conflict with the main app.
Those releases are primarily aimed for QA testing, if you need a stable version, please refer to the [Ledger Live Desktop](https://www.github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-desktop) repository.
